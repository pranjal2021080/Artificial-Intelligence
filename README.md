# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence

This repository presents a comprehensive set of assignments that explore **core concepts, methods, and applications of Artificial Intelligence**.
Each assignment focuses on a distinct area of AI, combining **theoretical foundations** with **practical implementations** to demonstrate both understanding and application.

The work emphasizes:

* Precise problem formulation
* Correct use of AI techniques
* Clear reasoning and analysis
* Empirical evaluation through implementation

---

## 🧠 Scope of the Repository

The repository covers a broad range of AI topics, progressing from **classical search techniques** to **modern machine learning and probabilistic modeling**.
Each main folder corresponds to a **major theme in AI**, and contains both the **assignment description** and a **complete solution** (theory + code).

## 🔍 Key Areas Covered

### 🔹 Search and Game Tree Algorithms

This section explores how intelligent agents make decisions by systematically searching through state spaces.

Topics include:

* Uninformed search methods (e.g., iterative deepening, bidirectional search)
* Informed search using heuristics (A*, bidirectional A*)
* Optimality, completeness, and efficiency analysis
* Adversarial search using minimax and alpha–beta pruning
* Empirical comparison of algorithms based on time, memory, and path cost

These problems demonstrate how different search strategies affect performance and solution quality.

### 🔹 Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, and Planning

This part focuses on how knowledge is **formally represented** and **logically reasoned about** by intelligent systems.

Key ideas include:

* Propositional Logic and First-Order Logic modeling
* Constraint formulation using logical axioms
* Automated reasoning using resolution and logic programming
* Knowledge-based reasoning using declarative (logic-based) and procedural approaches
* Planning using forward and backward chaining under constraints

Real-world transit data is used to show how symbolic AI techniques support reasoning and planning tasks.

### 🔹 Uncertainty, Bayesian Networks, and Hidden Markov Models

This section addresses decision-making under uncertainty.

Concepts explored:

* Probability theory and Bayesian inference
* Sampling techniques and belief updates
* Construction, pruning, and optimization of Bayesian Networks
* Probabilistic classification tasks
* Sequential modeling using Hidden Markov Models
* State estimation using the Viterbi algorithm
* Tracking and prediction from noisy observations

The assignments highlight how probabilistic models handle incomplete and noisy information.

### 🔹 Machine Learning and Decision Trees

This part focuses on **data-driven learning** and predictive modeling.

It includes:

* Decision tree construction using entropy
* Feature importance analysis
* Hyperparameter tuning and pruning
* Handling imbalanced datasets
* Model evaluation using standard regression metrics
* Residual and error analysis
* Ensemble learning using Random Forests
* Comparative analysis between single models and ensembles

The emphasis is on understanding both **model behavior** and **performance trade-offs**.
